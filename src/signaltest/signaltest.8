.SH NAME
signaltest \- signal roundtrip test software
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
signaltest [ -a|--affinity NUM] [ -b|--backtrace USEC ] [-D|--duration TIME] [-h|--help] [--json FILENAME] [-l|--loops LOOPS ] [-p|--prio PRIO] [-q|--quiet] [-S|--smp] [-t|--threads NUM] [-m|--mlockall ] [-v|--verbose ]
.SH OPTIONS
These programs follow the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options
starting with two dashes ('\-\-').
.TP
.B \-a, \-\-affinity[=PROC-SET]
Run threads on the set of processors given by PROC-SET.  If PROC-SET is not
specified, all processors will be used.  Threads will be assigned to processors
in the set in numeric order, in a round\-robin fashion.
.br
The set of processors can be specified as A,B,C, or A-C, or A-B,D-F, and so on*.
The ! character can be used to negate a set.  For example, !B-D means to use all
available CPUs except B through D.  The cpu numbers are the same as shown in the
.I processor
field in /proc/cpuinfo.  See numa(3) for more information on specifying CPU sets.
* Support for CPU sets requires libnuma version >= 2.  For libnuma v1, PROC-SET,
if specified, must be a single CPU number.
.TP
.B \-b, \-\-breaktrace=USEC
Send break trace command when latency > USEC
.TP
.B \-D, \-\-duration=TIME
Specify a length for the test run.
.br
Append 'm', 'h', or 'd' to specify minutes, hours or days.
.TP
.B \-\-help
.br
display usage information
.TP
.B \-\-json=FILENAME
Write final results into FILENAME, JSON formatted.
.TP
.B \-l, \-\-loops=LOOPS
Number of loops: default=0 (endless)
.TP
.B \-p, \-\-priority=PRIO
Priority of highest priority thread
.TP
.B \-q, \-\-quiet
print a summary only on exit
.TP
.B \\-S, \-\-smp
Set options for standard testing on SMP systems. Equivalent to using
the options: "\-t \-a" as well keeping any specified priority
equal across all threads
.TP
.B \-t, \-\-threads=NUM
number of threads: default=2
.TP
.B \-m, \-\-mlockall
lock current and future memory allocations
.TP
.B \-v, \-\-verbose
output values on stdout for statistics
.br
format: n:c:v n=tasknum c=count v=value in us
