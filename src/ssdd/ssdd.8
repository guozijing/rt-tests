.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
ssdd [-f|--forks NUM] [-h|--help] [-i|--iters NUM] [--json FILENAME]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Have a tracer do a bunch of PTRACE_SINGLESTEPs against a tracee as
fast as possible. Create several of these tracer/tracee pairs and
see if they can be made to interfere with each other. The tracer
waits on each PTRACE_SINGLESTEP with a waitpid(2) and checks that
waitpid's return values for correctness.
